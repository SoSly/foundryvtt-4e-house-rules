# SoSly 4e House Rules
This module is a collection of house rules for the 4th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. It is designed to be used by the
Society of Silliness, a group of friends who play D&D together.

## Long Rest
Once per day, you can gain the benefits of a long rest.

> #### Long Rest
> - **Duration:** A long rest requires that you sleep at least 6 hours.
> - **Once per Day:** After you finish a long rest, you have to wait 12 hours before you can begin another one.
> - **No Strenuous Activity:** During a long rest, you are expected to sleep, unless you have a feature which prevents the need (such as the Elven ability to enter a Trance). It is common for groups to spend 8 hours during a Long Rest, with 6 hours of sleep and 2 hours on watch for each member of the group.
> - **Regain Healing Surges:** At the end of a long rest, you regain 1 healing surge. After 11th level, you regain 2 healing surges, and after 21st level you regain 3 healing surges.
> - **Powers:** At the end of a long rest, you regain all your encounter powers and 1 expended daily power.
> - **Action Points:** At the end of a long rest, you gain 1 action point if you do not already have one.
> - **Interruptions:** If anything interrupts your long rest, such as an attack, add the time spent dealing with the interruption to the total time you need to spend in the long rest.

**Watchful Rest:** A Ranger with the Watchful Rest feature benefits from that feature during a long or extended rest.

**Wizard's Spellbook:** A Wizard can prepare their daily spells after a long or extended rest.
